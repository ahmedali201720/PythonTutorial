### Enumes
# Enumerate() method adds a counter to an iterable and returns it in a form of enumerate object. 
# This enumerate object can then be used directly in for loops or be converted into a list of tuples
# using list() method.

## all and any 

##Any 
# Any and All are two built ins provided in python used for successive And/Or.
# Any Returns true if any of the items is True. 
# It returns False if empty or all are false. 
# Any can be thought of as a sequence of OR operations on the provided iterables.
# It short circuit the execution i.e. stop the execution as soon as the result is known.
# Syntax : any(list of iterables)
print(any(L))


#All
# Returns true if all of the items are True (or if the iterable is empty).
# All can be thought of as a sequence of AND operations on the provided iterables. 
# It also short circuit the execution i.e. stop the execution as soon as the result is known.
# Syntax : all(list of iterables)
